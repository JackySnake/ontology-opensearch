    <skos:definition>Rapid Increase of the population of algae in an acquatic system. It takes place when there is an excess of nutrients in the water, particularly phosporus, and is aggravated when accompanied by a rise in temperature. Although the algae grow quickly they soon die because they have swallowed up all the water's nutrients.  Algal blooms are monitored using biomass measurements coupled with the examination of species present. A widely-used measure of algal and cyanobacterial biomass is the chlorophyll concentration.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition>Biochemical oxygen demand is a measure of how much dissolved oxygen is being consumed as microbes break down organic matter. A high demand, therefore, can indicate that levels of dissolved oxygen are falling, with potentially dangerous implications for the river?s biodiversity.High biochemical oxygen demand can be caused by high levels of organic pollution, caused usually by poorly treated wastewater; or high nitrate levels, which trigger high plant growth. Both result in higher amounts of organic matter in the river. When this matter decays, the microbiological activity uses up the oxygen. </skos:definition>

    <skos:definition>Organic matter, measured as Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) and ammonium, are key indicators of the oxygen content of water bodies.Concentrations of these determinands normally increase as a result of organic pollution caused by discharges from waste water treatment plants, industrial effluents and agricultural run-off. Severe organic pollution may lead to rapid de-oxygenation of river water, a high concentration of ammonia and the disappearance of fish and aquatic invertebrates.

    <skos:definition>Triclosan is an antimicrobially active substance used for many purposes such as disinfectants, preservatives and personal-care products. Triclosan is transformed to methyltriclosan in the environment through a path which is not fully understood. This substance persists in the environment and accumulates in organisms.</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition>Yellow substance, associated with decayed vegetation, sometimes referred to as DOM or gelbstoff, consists of humic acids and fulvic acids of various forms depending on their origin. It also influences water colour  through its absorption properties. It has strong absorption in the blue and high reflectance peak in the yellow. Some DOM is inevitably found wherever there is a phytoplankton population, being the decayed product od dead cells. Howevere it can also be found independentely of the local phytoplankton, coming tipically from land drainage, through river inflows to the sea. It is therefore likely to be found in coastal waters with strong concentrations in enclosed seas such as the Baltic.</skos:definition>
